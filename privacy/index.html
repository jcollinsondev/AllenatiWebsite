  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Allenati ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and the choices you have. By using Allenati, you agree to the practices described here.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We strive to collect as little personal data as necessary. Allenati may store the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Workout data you enter (exercises, programs, schedules and workouts).</li>
      <li>Local preferences (unit preferences, display options).</li>
      <li>Name provided during onboarding (used only for personalization within the app).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) for analytics or advertising</strong> unless you explicitly provide it (for example, via a contact form or support email).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Data Is Stored & Synced</h2>
    <p>
      Workout data and preferences are stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud sync, data is synced using <strong>Apple iCloud / CloudKit</strong> so it can be available on your other devices. You can disable iCloud sync in your device settings to keep data local only.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      In-app purchases (such as the optional one-time or with subscription "Allenati Pro" upgrade) are handled by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Purchase entitlements (e.g., whether you own Pro) may be stored in the app and shared via the App Group/UserDefaults for app extensions or widgets if implemented.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses Apple services (iCloud) for syncing. If you integrate other third-party services in the future (analytics, crash reporting, etc.), this policy will be updated and the services will be listed here.
    </p>
    <p>Apple Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy</a></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or trade your personal data. We only share data when required to provide the service (for example, iCloud sync). If lawful disclosure is required (e.g., by a court order), we will comply with applicable laws.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may delete the app to remove local data from that device.</li>
      <li>If using iCloud, you may disable iCloud Drive or delete data from iCloud to remove synced copies.</li>
      <li>If you have requests about your data (access, correction, deletion), contact us at the address below.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      Allenati is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
